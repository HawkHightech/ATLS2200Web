						ABA

					<p> 
						When the NBA was recieving a lot of attention in 1967, the American Basketball Association (ABA) was created in correspondence to the NBA. The original American Basketball Association (ABA) was a men's professional basketball league, from 1967 to 1976. The ABA offered an alternative game style as well as some changes in the rules. The 3-point shot was evolved into the game of basketball when the ABA became along. Julius Erving was the leading player in the league, and helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes the agression of the game. His playing strength helped certify the ABA. In the summer of 1976, the ABA was integrated into the NBA and its four most successful franchises (the Denver Nuggets, New York Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs) being incorporated into the older league.
