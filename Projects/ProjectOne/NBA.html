					<p> 
						The National Basketball Association (NBA) is an American men's professional basketball league. It is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, and was originally named the Basketball Association of America (BAA). On August 3, 1949, the named was changed from the Basketball Association of America (BAA) to the National Basketball Association (NBA) after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).

						The league incorporated the ABA's three-point field goal beginning in 1979. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA because both players faced each other in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game and later in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987). On February 1, 1984 David Stern became commissioner of the NBA and he has been a major role in the growth of the league during his career. Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls and expanded the fans interest in the game. The 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and star NCAA amateur Christian Laettner. The team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and 11 players & three coaches have been elected to the Hall of Fame as individuals. In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA G League, was created. A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006â€“07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons. As of the early 21st century, the NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
