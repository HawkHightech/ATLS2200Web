						Womens Basketball
					</h1>

					<p> 
						Women's basketball was developed in the late 1800s. Colleges implemented women's basketball and the game became popular is all around the US. Women's basketball was first called Netball, and evolved into the name of modern women's basketball. The <a href = "FIBA.html">FIBA</a> Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships.
					</p>

					<p>
						Early basketball was also played with peach baskets and soccer balls, similarly to the men's game, but women's uniforms reflected the victorian culture of the times and were designed to be practical, yet maintain the woman athlete's dignity and femininity. Trousers were loose and covered by a knee-length skirt, but as time evolved, the trousers were replaced by loose bloomers over stockings. The first intercollegiate women's basketball game was played between teams from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, on April 4, 1896. A major development in women's basketball occurred in 1982 when the <a href = "NCAA.html">NCAA</a> agreed to sponsor the sport.

					<p>
						The WNBA was formed in 1996 in parallel to the <a href = "NBA.html">NBA</a>, and league play began in 1997. Officially approved by the NBA Board of Governors on 24 April 1996, the creation of the WNBA was first announced at a press conference with Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes. The WNBA season runs from June to September. Most WNBA teams play at the same venue as the NBA. The league is divided into two conferences, the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference similar to the NBA.
