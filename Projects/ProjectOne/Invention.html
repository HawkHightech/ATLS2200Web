						Invention
					</h1>

					<p> 
						Basketball was invented in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian innovator James Naismith. Dr. Naismith was a PE instructor at the YMCA International Training School now known as Springfield College. He was 31-years old when he established basketball. The idea of basketball was to condition young athletes during the winter time. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. In the 20th century, the sport became more exposed around the globe. Basketball was first constituted in Colleges throughout America then followed professional games. In 1946, the American National Basketball Association ([A]NBA) was created and grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century. From the extensive love of the game, basketball became an integral element of American culture.
