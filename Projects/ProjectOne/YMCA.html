					<p> 
						When Dr. Naismith worked at YMCA International Training School, his boss tasked Dr. Naismith to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in the cold weather. He made the game of basketball with 13 rules (<a href = "OriginalRules.html">Original Rules</a>) and tested out his new game with his athletes on the Armory Street court. The game consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The eighteen players were John G. Thompson, Eugene S. Libby, Edwin P. Ruggles, William R. Chase, T. Duncan Patton, Frank Mahan, Finlay G. MacDonald, William H. Davis and Lyman Archibald, who defeated George Weller, Wilbert Carey, Ernest Hildner, Raymond Kaighn, Genzabaro Ishikawa, Benjamin S. French, Franklin Barnes, George Day and Henry Gelan. Someone proposed to call it "Naismith Game", but Naismith suggested "We have a ball and a basket: why donâ€™t we call it basketball?"

						The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. Only in 1906 were metal hoops, nets and backboards were introduced. Moreover, earlier the soccer ball was replaced by a Spalding ball, similar to the one used today.

						YMCA had a major role in spreading basketball throughout the United States, Canada, and the world. In 1893, Mel Rideout arranged the first European match in Montmartre, Paris. At the same time, Bob Gailey went to Tientsin, China, Duncan Patton to India, Genzabaro Ishikawa to Japan, and C. Hareek to Persia.
