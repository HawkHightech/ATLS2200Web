				The Narrative of Basketball
			</h1>

			<p> 
				As a kid, I have always been in love with the game of basketball. The reminiscing sound the net makes when the ball goes through the net, the endless practice of perfecting an AI cross-over, the silent crowds when Kobe Bryant has the ball with 7 seconds left on the clock, and the roars when Kobe makes it! Basketball is the pure form of art. Basketball is poetry in motion. Who would have known basketball would have made such an impact on so many lives and still counting? Well, where do we begin?
