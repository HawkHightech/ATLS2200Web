					<p> 
						The first professional league was founded in 1898. Six teams took part in the National Basketball League, and the first champions were the Trenton Nationals, followed by the New York Wanderers, the Bristol Pile Drivers and the Camden Electrics. Unfortunately, the league was abandoned in 1904. Soon after, many championships were organized. The Original Celtics are considered the <i>fathers of basketball</i> and were presented as <i>World’s Basketball Champions</i>. The players had to sign contracts to play with the Original Celtics traveled from town to town to play for money against challengers. Even though the Original Celtics have a similar name to the Boston Celtics, they are not the same franchise. The Original Celtics became the strongest team, and their successes lasted from 1922 until 1928, when the team disbanded due to ownership problems. 
					</p>

					<p>In 1922, the first all-African American professional team was founded: the Rens (also known as New York Renaissance or Harlem Renaissance). They were the Original Celtics’ usual opponent, and the price to enter the matches was $1. The Rens took part in official championships and won the first <i>World Professional Basketball Tournament</i> in 1939. In 1949, the Rens were also disbanded.</p>
