						The greatest level of early basketball activity outside of <a href = "YMCA.html">YMCA</a> was seen in American colleges. The first known U.S. college to field a basketball team against an outside opponent was Vanderbilt University, which played against the local YMCA in Nashville, Tennessee, on February 7, 1893. The first recorded game between two college teams occurred on February 9, 1895, when Hamline University faced Minnesota A&M and Minnesota A&M won the game.

						College basketball today is governed by collegiate athletic bodies including the United States's National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Governing bodies in Canada include U Sports and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). Each of these various organizations are subdivided into from one to three divisions based on the number and level of scholarships that may be provided to the athletes.

						Racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the regional agenda in the 1950s and 1960s. Involved were issues of equality, racism, and the alumni demand for the top players needed to win high-profile games. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) took the lead. First they started to schedule integrated teams from the North. The wake-up call came in 1966 when Don Haskins's Texas Western College team with five black starters upset the all-white University of Kentucky team to win the NCAA national basketball championship. That happened at a time when there were no black varsity basketball players in either the Southeastern Conference or the Southwest Conference. Finally ACC schools --typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups-- integrated their teams.

						In 1939, the March Madness national tournament was implemented. The location of the March Madness NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to only one locaiton. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased drastically became one of the mosst popular tournaments in the NCAA.
