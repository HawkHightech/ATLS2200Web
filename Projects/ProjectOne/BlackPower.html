						Black Power

					<p> 
						With racial segregation affecting all areas of public life in the U.S. including sports, all-black basketball teams (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Fives">Black Fives</a>) were established in 1904. Dozens of all-black teams emerged during the Black Fives Era, in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and other cities. The Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn and the St. Christopher Club of New York City were established as the first fully organized independent all-black basketball teams in 1906. The first inter-city basketball game between two black teams was played in 1907 when the Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn travelled to Washington, DC to play the Crescent Athletic Club. A year later, Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn, a member of the Olympian Athletic League, was named the first Colored Basketball World's Champion. In 1910, Howard University’s first varsity basketball team began. In 1922, the Commonwealth Five was the first all-black professional team founded. A year later, the New York Renaissance was founded. In 1926, the Harlem Globetrotters were founded. In 1939, the all-black New York Renaissance beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the World Pro Basketball Tournament. In 1942, the all-white National Basketball League began to racially integrate with 10 black players joining two teams, the Toledo Jim White Chevrolets, and the Chicago Studebakers. The NBA integrated in the 1950–51 seasons, just two years after its founding, with three black players each achieving a separate milestone in that process. In the draft held immediately prior to that season, Chuck Cooper became the first black player drafted by an NBA team. Shortly after the draft, Nat Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract. Finally, Earl Lloyd became the first black player to appear in an NBA game. After the integration of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters started to focus on international touring and exhibition performances, including comic routines. These tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the Globetrotters the reputation as Basketball's goodwill ambassadors.
