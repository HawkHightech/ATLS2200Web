					<p> 
						As basketball was evolving in the US, the rest of the globe also wanted to be involved in the beloved sport. On June 18, 1932, a real international organization was formed to coordinate tournaments and teams. Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland founded the International Basketball Federation (Fédération internationale de basketball amateur, FIBA) in Geneva. Léon Bouffard from Switzerland was the first FIBA president. In the first five years of FIBA's establishment, FIBA grew from 8 to 36 member federations. In 1940, FIBA's headquarters moved from Geneva to Bern. The first FIBA World Championship for men was in 1950 in Argentina; Argentina won beating the US 50-64 in the final. The first FIBA World Championship for women was in 1953 in Chile; USA won the gold medal that year. In 1956, FIBA's headquarters moved from Geneva to Munich, Germany. In 1989, the organizations responsible for running the sport on a continental level officially become the five FIBA zones. The five FIBA zones consist of Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. In 2002, the FIBA headquarters moved from Munich back to Geneva, Switzerland. The FIBA Hall of Fame was introduced in 2007. The latest chapter of FIBA's history is the inauguration of the House of Basketball.
